# AUV-Path-Following-Simulation

A 3D path following simulation platform for autonomous underwater vehicle on Matlab/Simulink.

It can run on Matlab 2020b and newer versions. Matlab must be installed Simulink 3D Animation toolbox.

AUV model using Remus100 in 《Verification of a six-degree of freedom simulation model for the REMUS autonomous underwater vehicle》.

The path following method in the platform is 3D line-of-sight guidance law and PID autopilot. 《Principles of Guidance-Based Path Following
in 2D and 3D》.
